## ☁️ Deployment

### Docker

Build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t api-deployment-explorer .
```

Run the container:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:80 api-deployment-explorer
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

### GitLab Pages

To deploy this Vite app to GitLab Pages, create a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file in the root directory with the following content:

```yaml
image: node:20-alpine

pages:
  stage: deploy
  cache:
    key:
      files:
        - package-lock.json
    paths:
      - node_modules
  script:
    - npm ci
    - npm run build
    - rm -rf public
    - mv dist public
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - public
  rules:
    - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == $CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH
```

This configuration:
1.  Installs dependencies.
2.  Builds the project (outputting to `dist`).
3.  Moves `dist` to `public` (required by GitLab Pages).
4.  Deploys the `public` folder.
